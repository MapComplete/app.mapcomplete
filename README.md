# app.mapcomplete

This repository has the website assets for [https://app.mapcomplete.org]. This domain and website is in the first place thes hook for Android apps to deeplink and to capture the authentication callback. 

As we have the domain as well, we might (one day) add a somewhat nice landing page which links to the play store and FDroid (once this is in place). See https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues/2112

The [actual source code for MapComplete is here](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete) - report [issues there as well](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues).
The boilerplate to wrap it into [the Android shell is here](https://github.com/MapComplete/android-wrapper-capacitator)
