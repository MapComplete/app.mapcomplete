# app.mapcomplete

This repository servers in the first place as hook for Anrdoid apps to deeplink and to capture the authentication callback.

And, as we have the domain as well, we might (one day) add a somewhat nice landing page which links to the play store and FDroid (once this is in place). See https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues/2112
